I'm an [Associate Professor of Physics][5] at the Western Norway University of
Applied Sciences. I am currently also a [Guest Editor][2] for the "Journal of
Superconductivity and Novel Magnetism".

I teach mathematics, physics, and programming for engineers; do research on
superconductivity (theory and numerics); and have a passion for programming and
computers in general. I was awarded the [Birkeland Prize 2020][1] -- a national
award for the best PhD thesis in Physics -- for [my research on
superconductivity in magnetic nanostructures][7].

Please see my [Google Scholar][3] for a list of publications or my [Github
account][4] for a list of open-source projects. Interested in collaborating or
sharing ideas? Feel free to send me an [email][6].
